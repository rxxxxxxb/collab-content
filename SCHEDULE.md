# Schedule
This is the tentative but proposed schedule for topics to be covered initially. Our list is extremely expansive and covers almost everything, so I'm going to be taking a stab at topics I've found most confusing for beginners, as well as topics that are constantly thrown around without a true explanation.

## Topics
  ### Basic OOP
  1. Print vs. Return
    * we will explai the actual function (no pun intended) of returning something, and what it means when something appears on the screen
  2. What is a class
  3. The concept of Abstraction
  
  ### Some modern terms in software engineering
  1. Framework vs Library vs API
  2. RESTful APIs
  3. Threads
  
Obviously this list is not exhaustive but they're the ones that I have the strongest grasp on right now to be able to explain clearly.
